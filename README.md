# Waves

To easily open the project in Qt Creator Click -> Open Project and then choose the Wavesv_2.pro.
If you did as i said, the full project would open immediately.

Also i recommend test it before displaying the project. If it has issue with version just create a raw project and copy the code from cpp and h files. And fill the source,headers in the file .pro as in this one.
